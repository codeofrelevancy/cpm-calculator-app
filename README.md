This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Automatic Installation

To automatically create a new Next.js project using the app directory:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app
```

`create-next-app` now ships with TypeScript by default.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## FAQ Section

FAQ - 1

```markdown
What is CPM?
```

```markdown
CPM stands for Cost Per Mile. Also known as Cost Per Thousand Impressions which is a metric used to measure the cost effectiveness of online advertising campaigns. It represents the cost of displaying an advertisement 1,000 times to a specific audience. CPM is often used to plan and buy display advertising, where the focus is on reaching a large number of people, rather than a specific target audience.
```

FAQ - 2

```markdown
What is the formula to calculate CPM?
```

```markdown
To calculate CPM, you need to divide the cost of your advertising campaign by the number of impressions received, then multiply by 1000. The formula is:

For example, if you spent $500 on a campaign and received 100,000 impressions, the CPM would be:

CPM = ($500 / 100,000) * 1000 = $5

This means it cost $5 to deliver your ad 1000 times to your target audience.
```

FAQ - 3

```markdown
When is it necessary to utilize a CPM calculator?
```

```markdown
A CPM calculator is necessary when you want to determine the cost-effectiveness of your online advertising campaign based on the number of impressions it received. It is particularly useful for display advertising campaigns, where the focus is on reaching a large audience, rather than a specific target audience.
```
